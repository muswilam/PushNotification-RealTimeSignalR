 * Alter Database db_name set enable_broker with rollback immediate;

- Check service broker

- Create custom hub 

-Create notification services class 

	Workflow 

1- Start connection at client-side 

2- When we made any changes in db sql dependency calls change event in notification services class

3- In change event we call our custom hub method (send) which directly calls client-side javascript function 

4- Which (JS method) basically calls get notification method in server-side
